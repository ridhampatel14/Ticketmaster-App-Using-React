                    As this site gives more information about the events and concerts in USA. I would like to give some insights of one spiritual event 
                    in india called 'Dev Diwali' which I attended in 2021 in varanasi, UP ,India. 
                    Dev Diwali of Varanasi is mostly popular because of many religious belief as Varanasi is known as the place for Hinduism and religious practices . 
                    On the day of Dev Diwali, most of the pilgrims come and donate rice or lentils ( Annadaan) as donating food is one of the good Karma in Hinduism.
                    Dev Deepawali in Varanasi is an experience worth remembering. During this celestial manifestation, every corner of the city comes alive with bright 
                    colours and glowing diyas. 
                    So, me and my family decided to celebrate dev diwali in varanasi. They decorates the whole city including river fronts (called ghats) , forts , 
                    boats , temples and all streets.

                It looks like stars have fallen down on the Earth to make the city all the more beautiful. 
                People are also of the view that on the day of Dev Deepawali, all the Gods descend to Varanasi to bathe in the Ganga River, 
                a fact that makes this festival extremely popular.
                On this auspicious day, a large number of devotees come together to take a dip in the holy Ganges. 
                They pray to goddess Ganga and offer flowers and light clay lamps or diyas in the evening. 
                According to Hindu mythology, the Hindu god Shiva killed a demon named Tripurasur on this day. Therefore, the festival, Dev Deepawali, 
                is celebrated to mark the victory of Lord Shiva over the devil. 
                Apart from this, the festival also marks the birth anniversary of Lord Kartik, son of Shiva.

                The famous Ganga aarti of Varanasi is performed on the banks of the river in the evening, which is a spectacular spectacle! Pilgrims, 
                travellers and tourists from all across the globe flock the city during this period to experience the grandeur of the festival.
                Besides being a significant religious festivity, Dev Diwali is also the occasion when the city remembers the martyrs. 
                The Ganga Seva Nidhi organises a program during this time, wherein wreaths are laid at the Amar Jawan Jyoti on the famous Dashashwamedh Ghat. 
                This is followed by a closing ceremony performed by the Indian Army, Navy and Air Force officers; the Bhagirath Shourya Samman 
                awards are also conferred later on.
